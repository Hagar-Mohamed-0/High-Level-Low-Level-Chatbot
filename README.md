# High-Level / Low-Level Chatbot

This project demonstrates a chatbot implemented at two levels:
- **High-Level (Java)**: A friendly text-based chatbot with keyword and entity parsing.
- **Low-Level (Assembly + CPU)**: A minimalistic chatbot running on a custom Logisim CPU using MIPS Assembly.

## 🔧 Components

- `high-level/`: Java-based chatbot using keyword/entity matching.
- `low-level/`: Custom CPU and Assembly chatbot implementation.
- `docs/`: Diagrams, architecture plans, and memory layout.

## 🎯 Goals

- Bridge understanding between high-level programming and low-level hardware.
- Demonstrate chatbot logic across the software-hardware stack.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java
- MIPS Assembly
- Logisim
- Git & GitHub
